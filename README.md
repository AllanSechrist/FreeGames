## 🛠️ Tech Stack

[React](https://react.dev/)
 – component-based UI

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
 – blazing-fast dev server & bundler

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 – utility-first CSS framework

[Free-to-Play Games API](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc)
 – data source

 [Daisy Ui](https://daisyui.com)
